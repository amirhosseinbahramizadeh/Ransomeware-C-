# Ransomeware-C++
RSA Cryptography for Ransomeware

I use the RSA_private_decrypt function to decrypt the message. This function takes the length of the encrypted message, the encrypted message itself, a buffer for the decrypted message, and the RSA key to use for decryption.
Make sure to replace private_key_string and encrypted_message with your actual private key string and encrypted message.
